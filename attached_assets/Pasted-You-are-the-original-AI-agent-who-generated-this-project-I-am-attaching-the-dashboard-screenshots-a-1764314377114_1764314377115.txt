You are the original AI agent who generated this project.
I am attaching the dashboard screenshots and codebase.
Please analyze the entire project and fix/add the following features without breaking existing functionality:

1. Excel Upload → Contact Import

Add a feature where the user can upload an Excel (.xlsx) file.
From that file:

Import name and mobile number columns

Show them in a table on the dashboard

Store imported contacts in backend DB (MongoDB / JSON / existing system)

2. Select Template → Send WhatsApp Message

Inside the dashboard:

When I select multiple contacts and choose a WhatsApp template

Send template message through Meta WhatsApp Cloud API

Show success / failed status for each number

All sending must work even for batches of 1000 numbers

3. Create Full Message Report

Whenever a message is sent:
Store in DB:

Contact name

Contact number

Template name

Variables used

Timestamp (IST)

Message delivery status

Add a new “Reports” page to display:

Date

Number

Message sent

Status

Time

Search + filter options

4. Receive User Replies (24×7 Window)

Add a webhook handler:

Whenever a user replies to a template within 24 hours

Store reply in DB

Show reply in dashboard under Inbox → Recent Replies

Each reply must show:

Number

Message

Timestamp

5. Fix Missing/Incomplete Code

Some parts of the project are incomplete.
You must:

Read the entire codebase

Understand the existing structure

Identify missing or incorrect parts

Implement all required features fully

Do NOT rewrite everything; extend the existing architecture

6. After Completing Changes

Provide:

Updated frontend code

Updated backend code

Updated API routes

List of new files added

Setup instructions

Testing instructions

End-to-end workflow so everything runs perfectly

Important

Do NOT change project structure unless absolutely required

Keep code clean and documented

Keep UI consistent with dashboard theme

Fix only required features

Preserve all existing working parts
